# Chamilo ONLYOFFICE integration plugin

This app enables users to edit office documents from [Chamilo](https://chamilo.org) using ONLYOFFICE Docs packaged as Document Server - [Community or Enterprise Edition](#onlyoffice-docs-editions).

The app is compatible with Chamilo v1.11.16 or newer. 

## Features

The plugin allows teachers to:

* Create and edit text documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.
* Co-edit documents in real-time: use two co-editing modes (Fast and Strict), Track Changes, comments, and built-in chat.

Supported formats:

* For editing: DOCX, XLSX, PPTX.

## Installing ONLYOFFICE Docs

You will need an instance of ONLYOFFICE Docs (Document Server) that is resolvable and connectable both from Chamilo and any end clients. ONLYOFFICE Document Server must also be able to POST to Chamilo directly.

ONLYOFFICE Document Server and Chamilo can be installed either on different computers, or on the same machine. If you use one machine, set up a custom port for Document Server as by default both ONLYOFFICE Document Server and Chamilo work on port 80.

You can install the free Community version of ONLYOFFICE Docs or scalable Enterprise Edition with pro features.

To install the free Community version, use [Docker](https://github.com/onlyoffice/Docker-DocumentServer) (recommended) or follow [these instructions](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/installation/docs-community-install-ubuntu.aspx) for Debian, Ubuntu, or derivatives.  

To install the Enterprise Edition, follow instructions [here](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/installation/docs-enterprise-index.aspx).

The Community Edition vs Enterprise Edition comparison can be found [here](#onlyoffice-docs-editions).

## Configuring Chamilo ONLYOFFICE integration plugin

On the Plugins page, find ONLYOFFICE and click _Configure_. You'll see the _Settings_ page. Enable the plugin and specify the _Document Server address_. 

## How it works

* To create a new file, the teacher opens the necessary folder and clicks the ONLYOFFICE icon "Create new".
* The user is redirected to the file creation page where they need to enter the file name and format (text document, spreadsheet, or presentation). The browser calls `/plugin/onlyoffice/create.php` method. It adds the copy of the empty file to the course folder.
* To open an existing file, the user chooses the _Open with ONLYOFFICE_ icon.
* The request is being sent to `/plugin/onlyoffice/editor.php?docId=«document identificator»`. The server processes the request, generates the editor initialization configuration with the properties:

  * **url** - the URL that ONLYOFFICE Document Server uses to download the document;
  * **callbackUrl** - the URL at which ONLYOFFICE Document Server informs Chamilo about the status of the document editing;
  * **documentServerUrl** - the URL that the client needs to respond to ONLYOFFICE Document Server (can be set at the administrative settings page);
  * **key** - the etag to instruct ONLYOFFICE Document Server whether to download the document again or not;

* The server returns a page with a script to open the editor.
* The browser opens this page and loads the editor.
* The browser makes a request to Document Server and passes the document configuration to it.
* Document Server loads the document and the user starts editing. 
* Document Server sends a POST request to **callbackUrl** to inform Chamilo that the user is editing the document.
* When all users have finished editing, they close the editor window.
* After 10 seconds, Document Server makes a POST request to **callbackUrl** with the information that editing has ended and sends a link to the new document version.
* Chamilo loads a new version of the document and overwrites the file.

More information on integration ONLYOFFICE Docs can be found in the [API documentation](https://api.onlyoffice.com/editors/basic).
